### DAY 21 SUMMARY :

- Today, i have made some changes in the table that i have created, because i have made some mistakes in some topics in the table, so i have changed that. After defining the proper table in the database, and i have already written some endpoints yesterday, today i have tried to get all the theater details in the array and with that theater, i can return the value of the details of the theater table, i have done this by using the pagination process(pagination process is nothing but converting the whole data inside the database into the small value by adding them all into the series of pages and also setting the limit for the pages like per pages must contain 5 data from the database table).
- After getting all details about the theater, i have tried to get the movie names (movie list) from the movie data table, this process of getting all the movies from the movie table is done by using the theater id that is also present in the movie table, like if the table consist of more than one theater id in that, it can fetch all the movies that is related to that theater.
- After getting all the theater details and also about the movies from the movie table using theater id as the input in the parameter, i have tried to change some logics in the post request of the booking details by adding some logic like first if the movie is present in the movie table, then it goes to the theater table and checks for the theater linked to that movie and then that will be entered into the processing table, i have created a processing table for adding this processing value into that table and my constraints are while starting the booking process for the seats in a particular movie, at the starting of the process it should show the status as processing and after 30 seconds the processing must complete with clearing the details from the processing table and the data must enter into the booking, for achieving these process i have changed the logic of the booking endpoint into inserting the value into the processing table first. 
- After making these changes in the booking process and i have also tried to move all the data inside the booking table with the use of the endpoint called complete booking, using this i have written two logics, like if the data present in the processing table, the data must insert into the booking table as well as the data from the processing table must also be cleared, i have used delete query for deleting the data from the processing table, i have also set a time period of 30 seconds in which the data first enter into the processing table while processing the ticket booking, after that 30 seconds the data must moved into the booking, if the data moved into the booking table, it means the ticket booking process have been completed or else the process failed.
- After this i have tried to get the available seats from the theater table using the theater id and with this i am going to change the available seats number according to the booking of the seats in the theater and in the movie. After this i have tried to get the number of seats filled in the theater with the use of the theater id as same as the available seats getting but i am getting the booked seats from the booking table.

#### Key Takeaways: 
- I have learned to write the logics properly to get and insert the data inside the table and also learned to write logics for checking the movie name from the movie table and theater name from the theater table and combining them to create the booking and processing table.
- I have learned about the syntax of the queries that were used in the drizzle ORM.
