### DAY 29 SUMMARY: 
- Today's class started with how AI generates answer for our text and how AI recognize and read our text, AI is a tool which can recognize and read human language and can also gives responses to the questions that human ask. How AI commonly generates answers for our questions, AI can convert our text form questions into tokens that they can read, tokens are nothing but the words that are the split form of the words that we are giving. Every AI has a size for number of tokens which they can read, they can only read that limited number of tokens. That is why AI can answer more properly for the questions that is specific, and cannot answer for those which is not that specific. 
- How AI convert words into tokens: AI splits all the words in our text form questions into words with 3 to 4 letters and can read those words and give response to those words. It also has a limited size for the tokens for them to read. And they can give basic answers for general question based on a particular word from the whole sentence, AI cannot be able to generate specific answers for general questions that has been asked. AI can only give specific answers for the questions that is been asked in a proper way and with some specific words. 
- Prompts for AI: For giving the proper prompt for the AI, we have to first tell them what is the need that we have and we can also use some conditions for them like if you complete this, you will get a reward. There are many types in giving the prompts to the AI for getting responses specifically, zero shot prompting, few shot prompting, chain of thoughts prompting, tree of thoughts prompting etc. 
- Chain of thoughts: This is the type of prompting where we can give the prompts in a connected manner, one file is connected to another. Steps required for generating an application, we can give the prompts to the AI in a step by step manner and AI can read step by step processes and give more proper and specific answers. 
- We have to give prompts to AI in the step by step process for the AI to understand it clearly and read them properly. For AI to generate code for creation of an application, we have to give input and prompts as a markdown files which consist of steps and requirements for the applications and the files have to be connected with one another and so that they can read the files in a step by step process and generate codes for the requirements in the files. AI can split the words in our requirement files into token and can generate code based on our requirements.
- We have to create folders in the project in vs code and upload that files that contain requirements of the project and have to give those files to the AI to generate code and there are two modes in the AI, they are planning mode and in that mode, the AI will read the prompts that we have given them and recognizes is that task completed or not and recognize and read the incomplete task and generate code for them and the another mode is generation mode. 
- What i have learned from this session: How to write requirements and updates of the project. How to store all the requirement files in the vs code and how to write prompts in the AI to work properly and to give the responses more specifically and how to generate codes for the project with the memory bank files and other requirement files for the project.

#### Ticket booking app(API):
- Today, i have done the debugging process to identify the problem in my API and endpoints and to check, if all the endpoints that i have written works as i need or not. After debugging the API, i have made some changes in my conditions that i have written and made some changes in the endpoints too. I have also written unit test cases for my endpoints.
- What i have learned from this : I have learned to debug the code and to change the mistakes in my app after debugging.
