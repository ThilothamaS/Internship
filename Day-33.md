### DAY 33 SUMMARY:
- Today, i have tried to movies and theater data from the database using the endpoints fetch all movies and fetch all theaters using pagination method. I have tried fetching data, but it showed some errors like db is not defined inside that particular function and then i tried to clear the error and to solve that problem, i have tried to understand where that problem arises from and then after finding the cause of the problem, i have cleared that problem by using the fetch data function inside another function instead of using it in the function where the onclick attribute is used. i have tried put these both fetch data from the database and also get location from the user inside the body onload attribute in the html, so that it will not cause any error, after using the onload attribute, the fetch data works properly.
- Then i tried to insert these fetched data inside the indexed db ( indexed db is a inbuilt storage db present in the browser and we can use it to store our data like storing in a local storage ), to store in the indexed db, first we need to create a database with a name and then we need to set a key path for the data to be inserted into the database properly and then after creating a key path, we need to add data into the db one by one using the method create index, and then we need to add the data into the database using the transaction and add methods.
- I faced some issues while connecting to the indexed database and i don't know how to clear those error, i have tried searching in the google like rechecking, am i using the proper syntax or am i give data in the proper way or not and i have also searched with the error statement which arises in the console, but i couldn't find the results for the error and i couldn't be able to connect to the database.
- Then i have tried to check the input data with the data which is available in the database, i have to do this in the function onclick attribute, so that the function will start running after the search button is been clicked.
- In this method also i faced problem because the data are not inserted into the database properly and the get method to get the data inside the database is not working properly. After searching for the data in the database, i also need check if the data is available or not, if the data is not available in the database, the webpage have to display, the movie or theater name is not available and if the search text is present inside the database, then it have to check if the input is a movie name or a theater name and if it is a movie name, it have fetch all the theater details related to the movie and if it is a theater name, it have to fetch all the movies available in the theater.

- Today's class started by discussing about the topics static, const, and final, static is the one, which can be declared inside the class and that variable cannot change, like we can access the static key with the class name itself, we don't need to access them with the object name. const is the one which is declared once and will never change the value, and final is the one, which can declared once and also the value for the final can be assigned only once, the value cannot be reassigned anywhere.

 
#### key Takeaways:
- I have learned about the indexed database connection and creation.
- I have learned about the usage of onclick and onload attribute in the html and how to access them in the JavaScript.
- I have learned about the static, const and final methods of variable declarations .
