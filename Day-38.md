### DAY 38 SUMMARY:
- Today's class has started with the topic of data management, data management is the one where the data that is information that has to be stored properly in the database, and it has be easy for the storing and it has be retrieved easily from the database if wanted, for all these data management is the important step. Data management means storing the data properly in the database for using it or updating it in the future, the stored data has to be in the proper structure and the stored data should not fill the maximum memory in the database, the data should be proper one and should not be of maximum load. 
- In this, first we have learned about life cycle of the data, the life cycle of the data means the stages that particular data goes through from its origin to its final deletion or destruction. Data creation is the process of creating data or the collection of the data, data processing is the process of transferring the raw form of data into formatted data, data storing is the process of storing the data within the database, data using or accessing is the process of using the data for the process like analyzing, for another business usage, etc. data archiving is the process of storing the less used data in the long term storage, data deletion is the process of deleting the data which is no longer needed. 
- Then, benefits of good data management, data management is the process of collecting, storing, using or accessing, protecting and deleting data securely and effectively. Data is the important thing in this digital world were everything is the data and everything we are using has the data management, the simple app we are using has the data management process, even the user sign in and sign out has been maintained as the data within the apps where the user has to sign in to use the app. Every single thing is stored as the data, so data management is the important part in developing a app or a web app etc. The good data management means storing and using the data securely without any other problems, efficient method of storing the data also be like storing every sensitive data properly by doing encryption process.
- Encryption is the process of storing the readable data in the form of unreadable code to protect it from the unauthorized accesses. There are two types in the encryption process, they are symmetric process, asymmetric process, in symmetric data there are only one type of key for both the process, in asymmetric type there are two keys one is a private key and other one is a public key. This encryption process were used for the web security, important files storage, etc.
- HSM is a hardware security module which is also used to store data securely. Linked list is the one which can be used to store data, this is not like arrays, array can be stored in different addresses and in the linked list, there two properties in storing the data like data and address can be stored within one and the address can be linked to the other and like this the data were linked together in the linked list and stored in the memory in the single address. 
- Tree and hierarchical data is the types of storing the data with the parent and child relationship, there must be a root, branches, leaf, etc. The tree can be structured in the shape like where everything can be connect into the single root that is the main part of the tree structure. There can be many number of child for a single parent and also the tree structure can be consist of many branches for the children and the child and the parents can be related together. 
- Flash based structure is the one where the data can be organized and stored in the flashed memory, graph is the non-linear type of data structure or also said as non-linear type of data storing, this graphs also includes nodes and edges, nodes are the data points like connecting points and edges are the connections between those nodes and these were connected together properly. Graph method means it will be like a normal graph, like a normal graph consist of the point and there are also lines connecting those point, in this term, the points in the normal graph are the nodes and the lines connecting them are the edges. 
- Database structures and types, database is the one which stores the data, there are many types of database, they are relational database and NoSQL database, relational database is the one which stores the data in the rows and columns in the proper manner and it can be queried using SQL and these are organized database and cannot be changed. NoSQL database is the one which can be used to store the data and it is flexible and the schemas can be changed and these stores data in the JSON format (E.g., MongoDB). 
- Data integrity and data quality means integrity is about making sure data is accurate, consistent, and reliable over its lifecycle and Data quality refers to how useful and trustworthy data is for its intended purpose.

#### Key Takeaways: 
- I have learned about data management and protecting the data securely and safely.
- Also learned about encryption and decryption of the data for the protection of the data from the attacks.
- Also learned about structures of data storage like tree and graphs methods.
- Also learned about database structures and different types of database.
