### DAY 41 SUMMARY:
- Today's class started with the topic of firebase, in that we have learned about fire store database and its connections, Realtime database and another one known as firebase cloud storage. Fire store is the one which is like a in-built cloud database in the firebase, it uses NoSQL document based, it has more efficient querying methods when compare to the Realtime database of the firebase, it also supports SQL types of document, here we can structure the database by document and collection, supports structured data and indexing, strong consistency and better scalability. 
- Firebase Realtime database, it is like real database and this stores within them like a JSON object, this also supports NoSQL type document, this contains a large document of JSON object(its a JSON tree), real-time syncing of data across clients, offline support, this stores simple, hierarchical data and apps that need instant updates. 
- Firebase cloud storage, this is a traditional type of storage method and it consist of object storage, it stores data in file based and organized buckets, this stores images, videos, pdf, etc. Secure file uploads and downloads, integrates with Firebase Authentication for security rules, storing and serving large binary files. 
- Then we have tried to connect our current project with the firebase by using firebase commands, then we have initialized the firebase in the current project, during initialization of the firebase, we have selected what are files that we needed for this particular project, like hosting and Realtime database, fire store, etc. that consist of many options and function and we need to select what is the function that we need for our current project, after initializing the firebase in the current project, it already created two files in our current project like one is the JSON file consist of the file name and hosting methods and another one firebase file.
- Then we have tried to host our current project in the firebase, in that we have faced some struggles like rewrites in the hosting, so the firebase hosting process didn't work for me, then again after deleting the rewrite files we have tried to host the app after rearranging the files, then it works.
- Then i have tried to use fire store to my current project, like creating a database in the fire store database and connected it with the current project i have, it is webpage, so i have connected the database with the project to store the data of the project.

#### Key Takeaways:
- I have learned about the functionality and the three types of database present in the firebase.
- Also learned about how to initialize firebase in our project and how to host our app to the firebase, to view it in the firebase cloud platform.
- Also learned about how to create database in the fire store and connections of the fire store with my app.
