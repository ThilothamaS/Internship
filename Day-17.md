### DAY 17 SUMMARY:
#### CONDITIONS IN PROGRAMMING:
- Conditions in programming is like giving a condition that true or false. And if the condition became true, the output for that condition will be displayed or another output will be displayed.
- There are three main types of condition in programming language and they are if, else if and else. These are the conditional statement where we can give the condition that can become true or false.
- For example, in the 'if statement' the first condition will be give, if that becomes true then the output for that particular condition will be displayed and if that becomes false, the second statement 'else if statement' will be give and the computer then read this statement and if this becomes true, the output for this condition will be displayed and if this becomes false and the computer will continue by reading the last statement and gives the output given for that statement.
- The conditional statement can be read line by line and it gives the output based on the conditions are satisfied or not. These if conditions are also similar to the function and structure of the conditional statement and functions will look similar.

#### LOOPS IN PROGRAMMING:
- Loops are mainly used for the iteration of the single condition or the process repeatedly. The syntax of the looping statement will look similar to the if conditions, like starting of the loop and giving a particular condition (the condition have three main components, the initializing variable, the condition to be satisfied and the increment or a decrement for that variables) and next to this condition there will be body of the loop statement inside a curly bracket.
- There are four types of loops and the two main types that are commonly used are for loop and while loop. The for loop will iterate the block of code for a particular number of times and this for loops will be used when the number of iteration is known already.
- The while repeatedly iterates over the condition until the condition becomes false and this will used when the number of iteration id unknown. 
- The loop will be mainly used to process each of the element that is present inside the collection of element and the collections like array, object, etc. For example, looping through the array of numbers to calculate the sum of the numbers. The conditions of the looping statement will be repeated until the condition is true. With the use of the loop we can also separate a string and store the letter of the string in the array.

#### Accessing the array:
- Array consist of a list of values that can be accessed based on their index value. The index value is the one that can used to access the collection of items like arrays and this indexes are similar to the properties in the objects. The index value starts with the 0 and continue until the array have the value, if array have 10 elements and index value end at 9.

#### Update function in crud application:
- Update function can be done by using the put request in the controller and that can accessed by using the update query and the update query can be used to update a value in the database and in the data table.

#### Delete function in the crud application:
- The deletion of a particular user can be done by giving the expiry time for the each user and if a user delete their account, the details of the user should not be vanished from the database but the end date for that one particular user have to change according to their end time.
- And also the deleted account can also be reactivated by using the update request and the user account can be reactivated again and given the end date as already available.

#### Getting all data present in the data table:
- To get all the data present in the data table can be done by using the pagination process in the database. Pagination is the process of breaking down the large set of data in the data table in the small, by adding the limited rows to pages in the database.
- A particular number of rows can be assigned to 1 page and the process continues and all the data that present in the data table can assigned inside the pages and this pagination method can be used for the easy retrieval of the data from the data table and also large number of data can also be accessed easily using this process.

#### Key Takeaways:
- Learned about how to do the update request in the database.
- Learned to delete the user account but keeping the data of the user still in the data table.
- Learned to get all the information by doing the pagination process in the database.
