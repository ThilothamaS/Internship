### DAY 36 SUMMARY:
- Mobile development: A mobile app is nothing but the product which is given for an problem that arises in the society, mobile app development is a process of creating a mobile app which can be accessed in both android and Ios, there are many steps in developing a mobile app and they are first we have sketch a full design of the app like just the boxes and text boxes and this method of designing is known as wireframing and after drawing a wireframing for an mobile app, then the second step is selecting a framework for the app to develop the application in them and there many types of frameworks and this framework is divided into two types and they are native and cross-framework.
- The native frameworks is the one which can be used for either android version app development or Ios version app development and the native framework will give the best version of the app and there is an another type in the framework and that is cross-framework and these type of framework can be used for the development of both android and Ios version in the mobile app and in this type, there are many types of frameworks are there, like flutter, react native, ionic, etc.
- These cross framework will used for the fastest development of the application and this not only the fastest and this can used to develop both android and Ios version of app in the same framework and if there is native framework, there are two types of codes have to be there for both android and for Ios and if there is any bug in the application that is been developed, we have to fix that issue in both the code and this will double the work of the developer. To reduce this double work, we can use this cross frameworks which will be effective for developing application for both android and Ios versions. 
- Here, we are using flutter framework for developing the mobile app, because flutter can be used for developing mobile apps, web app, webpage and even it is used to develop desktop app, and also using flutter we can develop a beautiful and user friendly app, this is why flutter is used mostly for app development, there is another two important methods in the app development, they are JIT and AOT and this is also known as hot reload and hot restart and in this JIT( just in time ), this can be a process of finding bugs in the application that we have developed and fix it right away and the app using this will be very slow and AOT( ahead of time ), in this method, if there is any bug found in the application, the error will be fixed and the app will be restarted and run from the first. After selecting the framework based on our use case, then we develop the app with the structured data in the app development.
- The data used for app development are material app, containers, rows, columns and text and images, these are some simple data used in the development of a page in the mobile app. First the material app is given as the big class which then contains everything inside them, inside them the properties were added like home, body, background color, etc. These classes are already defined in the flutter framework and we can use it for the framework, while developing a page with multiple container, we can't straight away give the container1, 2 like this inside the body of the page, to solve this problem, we are using columns and rows and inside them we can declare a children property which is a array and this contains all the containers in them, rows and columns can be used based on the arrangement of container inside the body.
- Flutter arranges every functions from the material app to the final row as a tree structure and in the top of the tree, the material app will be present and following by that the scaffold will be there, then columns in the page will be there, then the containers in the columns. Then, I also tried to develop a page in the app, I have tried to draw a wireframing for the page and then i written some code structure for that page.
- There are three types of stages in the app developed, they are dev mode, profile mode and production mode, the dev mode will consist of many logs in them and this will be used for debugging and only the developer use this app and profile mode, this will also consist of the logs, but in the low amount, and this can be used by both developer and tester and the production mode, this can be deployed into the google play store (android) and app store (Ios). 
- The flutter's architecture will look like first the framework, then engine for the developed app to run and test (For ex, skia) and then embedder, which is used to connect to the running platform(ex, kotlin).
- Stages of app development, identifying and understanding the problem, finding a solution for the problem and designing it as a app and then developing the app, then testing the developed app and then deployment.
- Today i have made some changes in the webpage i have been working on like fetching the details of the booking after the movie ticket has been booked and then displaying the data in the webpage, like if the ticket is booked successfully, it should display booking confirmed with the details and if the ticket booking is failed, it should display booking failed with its details.

#### Key Takeaways:
- I have learned about the basics of mobile app development, before this i have no idea of how mobile app being developed and now i got to know about that a little bit.
- Also learned about the frameworks used for developing mobile apps.
- Also learned about the data used for developing a page in the application.
- Also learned about flutter's architecture and the deployment of application in the play store and app store.
- Also learned about the different stages in the development of the application.
