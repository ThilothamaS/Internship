### DAY 23 SUMMARY:
- Today, i again made some changes in my ticket booking project based on the constraints to that project and that is, there has to be a 80% possibility for a ticket to success booking and there has to be a 20% possibility of the ticket booking to fail and based on this, i have made the changes in the project and the changes are based on a if conditional logic. If the number goes below 0.8, the booking will be a success and if the number is equal to or above 0.8 then the booking will fail and to generate this random number, i have used math. random () function, it is a in-built function in the JavaScript which will randomly generate numbers from 0 to 1 and not equal to 1. Using this math.random function i have written a logic before its deleting from the transaction table and enter into the bookings table, the data has to cross this if condition and if the number generated is lower than 0.8, then the data will be deleted from the transaction table and then enter into the booking table, if not then it will stop there and return a statement like "ticket booking failed". 
- After completing this, i have made some changes in my project to show a demo of my project to my mentor and i have made changes like generating a unique request id for every endpoint i have written and also made some changes like adding the logs in the proper places for the proper output. Then i showed a small demo of my project to my mentor and after the demo, anna told me make some changes in the project like the validity of the movie in the theater is 1 or 2 months and it should be given like "1M or 2M" and the fetch all details of the theater should be in reversed order like the recently added to the old one and told me to write a endpoint to fetch the details of the ticket bookings, also told me to add another endpoint that get all the available seats from the theater in that particular show and the fetched available seats should be in a array. 
- To make these changes in my project, first i have written a endpoint to fetch all the booking details based on the theater id and given the input in the parameter and then i have tried to fetch all the available seats from the theater based on the theater id and checking it in the theater and checking the theater name of that particular theater and then from the theater name and from the bookings table i have fetched all the booked seats that has booked in that table on the particular show for a particular movie and then i have written a for loop condition to iterate total number of seats in the array and comparing it with the already booked seats and then deleting all the booked seats from the array of total number of seats in the table.
- For fetching the available seats and comparing this with already booked seats in the booking, i have first merged all the booked seats of the name and after merging all the booked seats from the table, i have compared all array of the booked seats to the newly generating array of total number of seats in the theater and after comparing all the booked seats can be cancelled from the total number of seats in the table.

#### Key takeaways : 
- I have learned about the in-built function that is used for creating the random value.
- Also learned to write some logic to fetch all the available seats from the table.
- I have also learned about how to merge all the arrays inside the array of object using the map and flat function in the JavaScript.
