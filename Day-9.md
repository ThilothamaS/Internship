#### TOKENS, EXPRESSIONS AND COLLECTION OF EXPRESSIONS:
- There are many types of token that has been used in english language, they are noun, pronoun, verb, adverb, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, comma, question mark, exclamation mark, special symbols etc. and the combination of these tokens will give the expressions. Expression means a statement or a sentence or a interrogatory, it is like a group of tokens or words which gives a specific meaning.
- And the collection of these expressions gives the paragraph or a chapter and the paragraph must give a perfect meaning.
- These are not just for writing english language. This is also suitable for writing any language including programming language. For any language there are a particular syntax and semantics are there to write a language. This rules are not just for writing, these rules are also needed for reading and understanding purposes, without these tokens and expression english sentences and paragraphs will not give any meaning and also for programming languages, the syntax and semantics are important for human's understanding, if others read our code, it must be understandable for them too.
- These are the uses of tokens and expressions in english. Used to make a meaningful sentence. for example, i have to go to my home town. In this given sentence, I (Pronoun), have (Verb), to (Preposition), go (Verb),to (Preposition), my (Possessive Pronoun), hometown (Noun), . (Punctuation). This is how the english sentences are made using the tokens. 

#### COMPILATION PROCESS:
- Compilation is the process of converting high level language into machine level language (Binary language) that a computer can understand and can also execute to give the output.
- There are many steps in the compilation process, they are tokenizer, syntax anlysis, semantics, and converting into a machine code.
- Tokenizer is the first step in the compilation process and it is used to identify the tokens present in the given high level code and it identifies tokens by breaking down the code, the next process is syntax analysis is the second phase of compilation process and it is used to identify if the given code is valid or not, it works by receiving all the tokens and checks for the meaning to check its validity.
- Semantics means the meaning behind the rules and the semantic analysis is the third process in the compilation process and that is used to check if the given code gives the valid meaning logically or not and follows the rules of syntax properly.
-  Converted into machine code, it is the final stage of compilation process, the compiler moves to converting the high level code into the machine code with the help of code generator which converts into the machine code (Binary code).

#### COMPOUNDING:
- Compounding is the process of repeatedly applying the interest over and over multiple periods. For example, compound interest, is the interest calculated on both the initial principal and the added interest from previous periods. 
- Same as the compound interest in money, skills and knowledge can also be compounded when we repeatedly add multiple skills which is related to our already known skills and this is why inverted triangle shape of acquiring skills is more important.

#### Problem solving:
- Continuing to yesterday, today also I solved problems in the loop topic and practicing this daily, problem solving in loop becomes a little bit easy for me to solve and it became interesting also.
- Today, i have solved 3 problems like finding vowels in the given string, deleting the duplication or repeating letters from a string, and capitalizing the letter after every white space in a sentence.
- Trying to solve these problems, it is useful for me to learn new functions and keywords that can be used in the programming language (JavaScript).

#### Key Takeaways:
- Learned to solve problems using string.
- Learned what is compilation.
- Learned what are the steps involved in compilation.
- Learned what is mean by compounding and how the skills and knowledge can be compounded.
