### WEEK 4 SUMMARY:
#### MONDAY:
- Function : The structure of the function is like, declaring a function with the name and parameter inside the bracket and function body and a return type. Function statements only works when the function is called. There are two different types of steps in the function, that is declaration of the function and calling or execution of the function.
- Function can be declared inside a block and it can called multiple times as well and anywhere, function can be declared with the input and the operation can be performed which is inside the function body and the return type which returns the output.
- Class : This is a blueprint for creating the object and class has properties and method and this provides a structural and easier way to create a object. This consist of different types properties and that also consist of different values for those properties and the values for the properties can accessed using the property names.
- Monday, i have written endpoints for the crud project i have been created and also downloaded the insomnia app to run the endpoints in that and i have written create and get endpoint that day and i have tried giving input for those create request and run properly and i have also tried to get the elements from the data table using the get request using the user id and it also works properly.
#### TUESDAY :
- Continuing to yesterday, Tuesday we have recalled about function and its structure and the class and its properties.
Objects : objects are the one which has the structure like keys and values and it can be accessed through the keys which holds the value in the object and we can reassign the value by using the keys in the object.
- Constructor: A constructor is a keyword that can used to declare the properties of the object and this is used to start the properties and the object and can make the accessing of the values inside the properties a much more easier to access.
- Also a function can be declared inside a object and these function can only be used to declare the actions which can not be declared using the properties and the function can be used here and the action properties of the topic can given.
- classes are of two types, they are which has something and which does something and the first one can given using the properties and the second can be given using the function in the class.
- Tuesday, i have written a update function for the crud application using the update SQL queries.
#### WEDNESDAY :
- Array : array consist of a list of values that can be accessed through the index values and also the values of the array can be reassigned using the index value and these arrays are similar to the object and the arrays can be accessed through the index and the objects can be accessed through the keys and can also reassign the values of the object using the keys and these key of the object is similar to the index values of the array.
- Conditions : There are four types of conditions, they are if, if-else, else if and switch. If conditions are the one which only gives the output when the condition is true or this does not gives any output, and if else condition, this has two main ways to give the output, one if the condition becomes true gives output which is inside the if condition and other output will be from the else condition, and else if is the one which can be used when there are many condition in the problem and it can also has different outputs.
- Loops : These can be used to do not repeat any lines of the code and it must be followed in any programming language, the lines of the code must not be repeated for the output, for this type of repetition only the loops can be used. There are many types of loops are there, and for and while loops are commonly used loops among them. For loop has the whole condition inside them and this terminates at a point where the condition given is false and while loop is the one which can run until the condition is true and this does not have any other conditions to stop.
- These conditional and looping statements are comes under the functions.
- Wednesday, i have written the delete request for the crud application and also the validations for all the strings and password inside the which comes as a input. I have written two validation function, one is for string validation and the other one is for password validation.
- Also, I have created a end time for every user and if they wants to delete their account the data inside the data table will not be deleted and only the end time for the user will be changed into the time when the user have ended their account and also the account can reactivated using the update method and again the end date for the user will be changed if they again reactivate their account.
- I have also written a get all request which can be used to get all the data inside the data table and this can be done by using the pagination process of the data table in the database, the pagination is the process of converting the data in a limited level to a page and that page consist of a limited amount of data inside them and can be given as a output for the get all request, there can be a limit set by us for the data to be inside the particular page.
#### THURSDAY :
- Reassigning the data inside a variable, a array and an object. Reassigning the data for the variable and when a value is declared inside the variable and that can be assigned for the another variable and again reassigning the value of the first variable into another variable and the output for the both can not be same, because the value is assigned to another variable and that will be stored inside a another address and that will not change the value of another variable when changing the value of one.
- Reassigning the value inside the array, the array can accessed using the index. We can also reassign the values using the index. Declaring the variable with a array and declaring another variable and assign array1 values. When reassigning the index values of array 1 can also make the difference in the array2 because these two were stored in the same address in the memory and also we are accessing the same array. So, the output of these 2 will be same. While changing the whole array make difference.
- Reassigning the value inside the object, the object can accessed using the key. We can also reassign the values using the Keys. Declaring the variable with an object and declaring another variable and assign object1 values. When reassigning the key values of object 1 can also make the difference in the object 2 because these two were stored in the same address in the memory and also we are accessing the same object. So, the output of these 2 will be same. While changing the whole object make difference in the output.
- Functions: There are 2 types of inputs given for a function. pass-by-value and pass-by-reference. Pass-by-value will directly pass the values from outside to inside the function without any changes. pass-by-reference will refer the value to the function from outside.
- As I completed the CRUD application, I have assigned with the another new project on Thursday. It is a ticket booking app and I am really confused. I can't able to get any idea to start the project. I feel like CRUD application is more simpler than this project and I do not understood the concept clearly that is why I did not get any idea. Then I tried to breakdown the problem and tried to understand it first and I took a note for what I have to do. I wrote a key points to solve the problem. Then I got some idea to start the project. I faced an issue for connecting the database to this project. And I tried using drizzle ORM for this project for connecting many relational data tables in the database.
#### FRIDAY :
- Datatype: There are two types of datatypes. Primitive data type and complex data type. There are three primitive data types - number, Boolean and string and complex data types are array, object and map.
- Conditions: There are four major types in conditional statements, they are if, if-else, else-if and switch. Switch type of conditional statement is the one which can be used instead of else-if conditional statement. It is a easier way of giving many condition for a single program. The structure of the switch conditional statement is switch, cases and a break.
- And then we have recalled about the loops, they loops in the program can only be used to do not repeat any lines of the program again and again.
- And also learned about how to read a function properly by step-by-step process and how to give a proper output for a function. We had a test using function topic on Friday and in that test we have to only write the output for the given programs by understanding the program properly.
- I have finally connected to the database using the drizzle ORM on Friday after many struggles, I have not used these type of ORM before in the crud application, but in this project, i have used this drizzle ORM and completed until connecting to the database.

#### Responsibility :
- In the afternoon, There is a session takes place for our self-improvement and to be responsible in our work. In this session, I have learned about how to make goals and how can i work to achieve my goals. And anna had said that if you really want to learn something new, you have to take that as your responsibility, not every time there is someone to push you to do something, you have to take the decision and you have to be responsible for the decision what you have made. 
- And anna said that don't just be here for the internship or certification or a full-time job, if you just think of these things while doing this internship, you can't learn anything new here. You have to be curious to learn the new things and anna said that your are working with the real developers and you have a separate mentors for yourself, you have to make use of them and learn something new everyday here.
- Anna also said that, if you really like something, you will go towards that without even your knowing, so do everything wholeheartedly. Anna also give some examples from the senior developers, who wholeheartedly learn this and like to do this work. 
- Anna said to set a goal for this remaining 3 weeks and work towards that goal from now on.
- what I have learned : Responsibility is the one which will move us towards the leadership and this helps us make wise decision, a responsible person can really make wise decision and he will face the consequences for that decisions also. Responsibility is also important in the team work also, a responsible team player can done any task perfectly and on time. I have to be responsible for what i have decided to do, I have to set the goal and have to work hard and achieve that goal too. I have to be interested and have to be curious to learn new things and because i am not from the core computer science, i have to put more efforts than others to learn things fast, and i have to be confident in my decisions and also have to face the consequences.
