### DAY 27 SUMMARY:
- Today, class starts by giving a list of task and how to complete those task in a efficient way possible in step-by-step. The list of tasks are buying groceries, organizing groceries, putting clothes to laundry, putting clothes to dry and folding the clothes, the most efficient way of doing all these 5 tasks are putting clothes to laundry, buying groceries, putting clothes to dry, organizing groceries and folding the clothes. These 5 tasks should be completed one by one and 2nd step should start only after the first step completed. What if these 5 steps are given as a function, to complete these steps one by one, there is a method in programming called call back function, this is a method where we can call the first function and passing the another function into that first function and that another function will be passed into the second function to start that after the second function completed.
- This will be sometimes looks messed and readability of the code will be low, so to increase the readability of the code, another method was there in the programming language, called promises. This method also leads in the step-by-step completion of the task, this make the code easier to read and write, it makes the code simpler. This promise function (.then) will be the one which will make the code look like one after the another with the then function and sometimes this code will also looks messed and the readability of the code become low if there is more 50 function in the project, so this will also leads to the lowering of the code readability.
- To solve this problem, there is another method in programming language called async and await functions, this will makes the function asynchronous and the second function will wait until the first function completed fully and returns the output. Only then the second function will start working and also this will even be possible more than 50 functions too. This will not lower the readability of the code, because no function is going to be passed into another function, because of this the readability of the code will increase. Asynchronous function allows the function to run and the await keyword in the async function will stop the function from running until the asynchronous function completed.

#### Ticket booking app(API):
- Today, i have written a endpoint to fetch all the theaters with the movie name, shows, location and date. Here location and shows are optional one, we can able to fetch the theater details even with or without the shows and location, Fetching the details of the theaters where the input movie is displaying and also if the shows given, it should also check the shows if its there in the list of shows that the movie have, also it has to check the location, the location will not be given as the address in the input, so it needs to check that whole sentence of address for the location and needs to give that as the output, and finally it has to check the date, where the input date is in between the validity of the movie and it should not be a past date and not to exceed from the validity of the movie.

#### Key takeaways:
- I have learned about how to write conditional statement in the where condition.
- I have learned how to set the input as a optional one.
- I have learned about how to use asynchronous functions in the program.
