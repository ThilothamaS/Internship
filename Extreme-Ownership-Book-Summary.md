This book consist of mainly three parts, the first part talks about responsibility, ownership and how a leader should lead a team and take responsibility over their team, the second part mainly talks about the basics laws, these laws are mainly to follow in the situation that goes out of control, and finally the third part talks about how to acquire the victory after practicing and following the laws. The author of the book shares their experience and the lessons they learn from the battlefield. 

 

#### chapter 1: Extreme ownership: 

- This chapter takes place in the eastern region of Ramadi which is also known as the mala'ab district. In the start of the first chapter, Willink started by narrating about the battlefield and how the battlefield looks with full of fog, the fog surrounded the area and this fog is because of the fire and burnt tires, the fog captures the area and this fog blocks the vision of the soldiers who were fighting in the battlefield, this fog also leads to confusion among the soldiers who were fighting and also the communication between them also got broken because of the fog, they totally had four separated elements of seals and when the sunrises, all the enemy troops started to shoot and the messages were coming from different parts that saying soldiers were being killed by the enemies and all of the seal sniper had been attacked and now they are in the serious gunfight. A U.S. advisor reported that they were engaged in the fierce firefight and requested a QRF(quick reaction force), this means they were in pain and needed a urgent help, Willink requested the seal for accompanying him to the tank to see if they can provide any help for those who has been in the need of QRF, he realized in the middle that one of the seal sniper teams were not in their exact position that they were planned earlier and they were relocating to the another place and he found out that there was some changes and his mind was telling him that something going wrong, as his mind says the one of them betrayed them, then putting a serious fight with the others and it was clear for him, one of the seal chiefs did that betrayal for them and it was blue-on-blue clear for him, it was like a friendly fight between the groups, the friendly fire means the fight was between the soldiers of the same team.  

- This chapter is all about the incident of betrayal, at the end of the day Willink accepted all the blames that were given for them for not winning any of the battle, he taken the responsibility of all the happenings and also accepted the blames because he was the commander of the team and because he was the commander of the team, he accepted all the blames for the mistakes has been takes place in the battlefield, this gained him some respect, because for others mistakes he accepted all the blames, then a business organization called him because they need his help for solving the problem going on in their organization, there was a fall in the organization because of them always trusting the plan of the vice president, but the plan was not working that well every time and every time if they ask the VP, he will give some excuses or blame others for his mistakes, to solve this, there was a meeting takes place between the vice president and Willink, in between their conversation, VP told that everyone in this company considering my plans and not even executing my plan, they always say that this will lead to failure without even executing the plan, Willink starts by saying that don't always think that you are always right and that is why you are always blaming others even if it's not their mistakes, take all the blames yourself to make the people under you to execute your plan. The organization or any team's leader should take responsibility for the mistakes that happened in the team, if the leader starts to blame others, it will be a stress for others, and they won't listen to the leader after that.  

- Key Takeaways: In any organization or in any team, there will be failure or success, the leader should not blame others, if that not their own mistakes, the leader should take responsibility and should understand others feelings and also need to accept all the blames, the leader should take responsibility of their job, they should take extreme ownership of everything that is impacting their mission, this principles are not only for the mission and battlefield, it can be applied to any organizations that consist of the teams and leaders, like in the case of the VP, he had made many excuses and played many blame games for their failure, a proper leader should not blame others, they should take the blames, even if it's about failure and not getting to the target, A leader who is fond of making excuses and blaming his coworkers can be very harmful to the attitude and motivation in the working environment. 

#### Chapter 2: No bad teams, only bad leaders: 

- This chapter is all about the hell week that happens in the last week of the training for the young students who had joined the navy forces training, in this they were going to do a underwater demolition, the seal training course is known as the BUDS, this is just a basic training course in the seal, there were many young people started this course at first then after 48 hours in the hell week, most of them were surrendered in the DOR or drop on request, they were all gave up on their dream in this hell week, this is not just a physical test, it is basically a mental test, the one who win in the physical also fails in the hell week's mental ability test, Willink supported the hell week as the instructor, he also came through all these stress and came to this stage. The BUDS training students were divided into two teams and each team was assigned with a leader and these teams were supposed to sail the boats, then in that team A performing well when compared to team B, then they tried to swap the leaders between the two teams, then still team A was performing well because they were going on with the teams spirit not with the command of the leader, and after changing the leader team B also started performing well because of the change and motivation. Willink observed that it was not because of the bad team, it was because of the bad leader. 

- At the business perspective, Willink was invited to help a company who were now facing hardships, this is mainly because of the CTO of the company, who is only good at framing excuses and blaming his juniors, this will not come under the extreme ownership, after talking to Willink, the CEO of the company started liking the concept of extreme ownership, then Willink also said to him that change the CTO of the company and after changing the CTO, the company also began to improve and the company also agree with the extreme ownership. 

- Key Takeaways: It pays to be a winner, it means you must do something, and you must sacrifice something to win your goal. Also, the winning is not about team, it is only about the leader who leads the team, this becomes true in every organization and teams, the leader should take the responsibility and ownership. 

#### chapter 3: believe: 

- This chapter starts by Willink saying about his team and their years of experience as the seals, about the many years his team has worked together, and how it has proved to be a reliable and effective team. They have had many years of training and combat experience that they can even determine each other’s movement. Willink says that even in the dark, they were able to locate each other’s silhouettes. The problem started when they included the Iraqi soldiers with them, Willink always says that Iraqi forces are one of the worst force in the world, because most of them joined the army for a paycheck due to the bad economic conditions, they were also poorly trained and had no basic war equipment and uniform and  more importantly, the Iraqi soldiers were poorly motivated and trained. They all were resisted when the message came as it says Iraqi forces are going to join them, they thought this make the mission they must win to more complicate and harder; they also have the fear of any mistrust happens between them and the Iraqi forces. 

- After some critical thinking, Willink realized that this was not about winning the war, it was about how to protect the peace and stability of the country, and if they could not train the Iraqi soldiers to protect their own country, he also realized that there was a reason why the order wanted them to include the Iraqi soldiers in their operation and the reason was that, maybe, it was time for the Iraqi soldiers to be independent and learn how to protect themselves. To make others believe and realize, He arranged an urgent meeting to convince them to believe and understand the order, in which he was successful. Willink made others realize that if they didn't teach them how to protect themselves, then they will not go home, they will be here in Ramadi protecting the Iraqi citizens. 

- Application in the business, Willink was pushed to be in the place or organization where the middle manager of the organization complaining about the compensation plans in the planned by the company's management, they were argued about this plan will definitely push the sales persons to the competitors, the middle manager needs to support the company even at the worst situation, but they are opposite to that like creating rumors and also making excuses. 

- Key Takeaways: Even if it's a bad or worst situation, we should believe ourselves first, then we should also believe our surroundings and there must be a reason behind everything that happens, that will direct us towards the winning. 

#### chapter 4: check the ego: 

- This chapter starts by Willink narrating about the sudden attack by the enemy to their troops, in the late hours, the attack has been started at sudden, and also they can't even react that fast at that moment, but still everyone in their got ready with the helmets on and with the weapons ready, some were only with the shorts and T-shirts, but still they have helmets and the weapons with them to fight at that late hours. It was dawning on Willink that since the beginning of the 3rd deployment in Iraq, the level of sophistication and determination of the insurgents became quite alarming. This was far greater than any resistance the seals had encountered in their previous deployments. After a month of operations in Ramadi, Willink says the teams have mastered the area and discovered strategic places to position themselves when the enemy attacked. The number of insurgents killed under Task Unit Bruiser-grew to unprecedented levels. Willink says that every Iraqi soldier killed meant one more day of survival to U.S. soldiers. It also meant the Iraqi inhabitants were guaranteed another day of peaceful stay. The ground platoon commander felt inferior because he taught the troops from the American advisors, and the Iraqi soldiers were more trained and equipped than the seals from Task Unit Bruiser. He was worried that the guys could be better and possibly take away their mission. Willink found himself between two sides who could not swallow their self-importance and work together as a unit. The group of American advisors clearly stated that they will not take any directives given by the SEAL platoon commander. Willink resorted to calming their egos and engaging them to work closely during the field operations. This was important because the enemy was not within, but rather the insurgents who were in the streets of Ramadi ready to kill and injure innocent individuals.  

- Application in the business, Willink and Babin met a person named Gary, and he complaining about the superintendent working under him had violated the basic operational standards by swapping out a critical piece of equipment, this is not only because the superintendent not clearing the equipment, but it was because of his ego, they helped Gary to overcome from his this attitude, and also they had a talk with the superintendent, even though it was the superintendent's mistakes, Gary as the leader should not show this attitude to the superintendent. 

- Key Takeaways: Ego will cloud everything and disrupt everything, so the leader or a normal people should not have the ego, this will also not allow themselves to hear any advice from others, sometimes the ego will destroy the person. 

#### chapter 5: cover and move: 

- This chapter starts by saying how they protect their troops by using the snipers and machine gunners, this operation is also called as sniper overwatch.  The U.S. Army had adopted a radical and innovative strategy to take back Ramadi from the malevolent clutches of the insurgency. They had to go deeper into enemy territory, conquer them, and establish outposts to protect those gained. This was aimed at weakening the enemy and reducing operational boundaries. On one operation, Team B arranged a large cordon and search operation that spanned several blocks from the heart of their bases but yielded no results. The teams found themselves deeper inside enemy territory. The operation ran almost up to the early hours of the morning, and no incident had happened so far. The platoons’ commanders now had to come up with recommendations on whether to continue with the operation or pull out and go back to their bases. 

- Application in the business, there was one production manager who was complaining about how the workers from the subsidiary company owned by the parent company was slowing down the production process, this was because they were never completing their jobs on time, this will lead to many struggles in the company like increasing of the downtime cost and that will affect the company's revenue.  Babin advised the manager to look at the general organizational mission and stop laying excuses on the workers from the subsidiary company. The overall organizational mission is the one guiding the manager, and not his agendas and ego. He had to own it all and accept that the blame was on him and him alone. 

- Key Takeaways: Every team in the organization should work together, they also must focus on their work first and do not focus on how others been doing their work, this will sometimes lead to rely on excuses and blame games. it says that it is important for the leaders to maintain perspective on the strategic mission and constantly remind the teams that they are part of the bigger team. 

#### chapter 6: simple: 

- This chapter begins by Willink explaining how they were protecting themselves from the series of attacks from the enemies, they were continuously attacking them with the 120mm mortar rounds and most of them were dangerously injured, they were in the building and were getting attacks by dangerous explosives, this was just another awakening of how the insurgents were improving and sophisticating their operations. There was a young American soldier in charge of the MiTTs who wanted to take the Iraqi soldiers to patrol the territories of the enemy so that they could test their mettle. Out of his excitement, The MiTT leader had ignored the dangers that he was exposing himself and the troops that were to accompany him. Willink saw it important that the leader present to him a map of how he is going to cover the operation. He assigned a few elements of the SEAL team to accompany him in his mission. Post analysis, Willink found out that the route the MiTT commander was planning to take was quite complex and dangerous, and advised him to take the shortest route possible to minimize the dangers they were exposing themselves.  

- Application in the business, he visited a manufacturing plant of a client company to help them to develop a simple bonus compensation plan by replacing the harder one that was quite hectic for the employees to understand. 

- Key Takeaways: simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success. when plans and orders are too complicated, people will never understand them, then definitely the things go wrong because of the misunderstanding, simple is not only for the plans in the battlefield but also for every organization and team, the plans and communication need to be very simple for everyone to understand. 

#### chapter 7: Prioritize and execute:  

- This chapter was started by saying about how the soldiers, technicians and seals was getting attacks by the nonstop machine gun fires by the enemies, all they can only do under this situation is hit the deck and try not to get their head shot off, they were almost pressing against the floor and RPG-7 rockets followed in rapid sequence of three or four, exploding with tremendous concussion against the exterior wall, the fury of the attack then subsides, and the SEAL snipers return fire with devastating effect. Willink, who is the platoon commander, then makes his rounds by checking room after room on the status of his guys, to ascertain that none was hit, he then passes the same report over the radio to the U.S. Army, the SEAL platoon then identified a building just up the street from a mosque that frequently rallied the call to jihad from its minaret speakers to the hundreds of well-armed Muj that occupied the area. The building was convenient for its commanding view of the area, where it was located right in the backyard of the enemy.  

- Taking a position in that building meant that an honest had been stirred. The plan was to get to where the bad guys would least expect you to be to disrupt their program, kill many of their fighters, and decrease their ability to attack nearby U.S. Army and Marine Combat outposts. The fighting intensified and the SEAL snipers engaged and killed many of them, while SEAL machine gunners returned fire into enemy positions. This chapter also describes about the challenges they faced during departure given that the building had only one entrance and exit. One of them also leads to the street, the most dangerous street where he lies helplessly and this creates a dilemma. He must strategize on how they were to get downstairs in time before the explosion of the charge that was detected and organize medics to attend to the soldiers on the ground.  

- Key takeaways: There can be many problems and challenges can be there in an organization but the leader must be calm and make the best decision possible, if there are many tasks to complete and if the leader starts depressing over the number of tasks, the team may be fails, instead the leader should identify which task has more priority and have to complete that task. 

#### chapter 8: Decentralized command: 

- This chapter started by saying about how the soldiers and snipers were prepared for the another program to kill the enemies, they all were well trained and have many skills and equipment with them and the enemies have only the few trained members who were daily killing and wounding some of our U.S. army soldiers, and today the main job for the Willink was to pass the commands and have to control thirty plus seals and their partner force of iraqi members, and he decided to give the decentralized commands to their soldiers, this meant he had to organize all the SEAL officers, including Babin, their platoon chiefs, and senior petty officers, and mandate them with the role of decision-making and execution. He describes how the operation began by both the Charlie and Delta Platoons occupying their preselected locations in which they were to carry attacks from. They ensured that many possible enemy ingress and egress routes have been covered, positions that mutually support each other had been set up, and solid fighting positions that could defend them against heavy enemy attack had been picked. 

- Application in the business: Decentralized Command enabled them to coordinate and effectively manage risk, prevent disaster, and accomplish their mission. Just like in military combat, business managers also need to practice mission planning as an integral part in achieving success. Effective lines of communications need be kept and decentralization of duties to junior trustees is critical. The CEO (Chief Executive Officer) should then play the role of coordination and giving a go-ahead in execution activities. 

- Key Takeaways: no leaders can maitain 10 to 15 members at the same time, so to solve this problem the bis team must be broken down into the team of four to five members and have to assign a leaders for each of the teams, the leaders should first understand all the tasks completely and then separate the task and give it the junior leaders, they should lead their team and have complete the given task within the given time, they should coordinate the team that is given to them and should complete the task as efficient and effective as possible. the leaders should first understand the task, it's like they should not only understand what to do and they should also have to know why they are doing this, if the leaders did not understand why they should ask their boss to explain them why they are doing this. 

#### chapter 9: plan:  

- This part started by saying about how they got prepared for the rescue of the innocent who had been kidnapped by the enemies force, a young iraqi teenager , the nephew of the iraqi police ahs been kidnapped by the al qaeda-linked terrorist and they also demanded their families ti give them $50,000, threatened the family by saying they will otherwise kill the young one, this was common in ramadi and anar province in those days,  Babin narrates how missions like this are sometimes difficult to execute because of the fact even though they are the enemies to kill, there is also the innocent victim to save. In the recent kidnapping cases that had happened in the area, the terrorists tortured and killed the hostages and, in some cases, they went on to kill them despite the families paying the ransom, the cruelty of the terrorist necessitated Babin and his teams to come up with a plan and instigate as soon as possible.  

- The plan had to be developed from the intelligence the troops were receiving from the teams in charge of this information. They had located the area and confirmed the target was in the enemy controlled area, and thus it would be a bit difficult to save the hostage. Regardless of these dangers, it was still important for the troops to participate in the mission. They developed a plan that was strategic in maximizing the success of the mission, while minimizing the assault and casualties on their part. Like this also in business application, willink helped the vice president to make the perfect plan to complete every tasks in their company. 

- Key Takeaways: before starting the planning the leader nust first understsnd the mission completely and then he have to explain it the frontline troops or the juniors leaders to make them understand what is the key of the mission, then after understanding the mission properly they can plan and execute the plan properly. 

#### chapter 10: Leading up and down the chain of command: 

- This chapter starts by saying about how the U.S. security was struggled at the enemy attack, it was positioned at the heart of the ramadi and was getting attacked by the enemies. The set-up of the story is in Camp Marc Lee, Ramadi, in Iraqi. Babin, the narrator for this chapter, presents us with a flashback of their experiences during their fight with the insurgent. This comes at a time when their troops are preparing to leave. He then highlights instances of some of their guys getting wounded, such as Mike Monsoor, who lost his life in the battle. In a different scenario, Babin reveals to us how he noticed the negative changing attitude of some soldiers, and concludes that it was a failure on his part, as a leader, for not explaining to them effectively and with clarity. He concludes that he would have put together a routine strategic overview brief and regularly deliver the same to the platoon operators so that they could understand the mission to be accomplished, furthering the strategic goals of stabilizing Ramadi and securing the populace. This is the ideal process of leading down the chain. Leading up the chain requires one to tactfully engage with the immediate boss or higher HQ in order to obtain decision and support necessary for the team to accomplish its mission and ultimately win.  

- Application in the business:  businesses have a number of managers operating from top management directors, senior managers, field managers, etc. Management, therefore, needs to come up with a more effective line of communications that will enable efficient flow of information in order to achieve success. Field managers should be made aware of all that is happening in the HQ, and they should be able to feed forward effectively. 

- Key Takeaways: the leader should understand the main mission completely, that when they can lead a team and move them towards their goal, they have inght into the bigger picture and why the specific task to accomplished, the junior does not need to understand the complete project and does not have the need to have that insight of the leaders, they should understand what the tactical plan is and should follow the plan, the senior leaders also does not have the need to know about the tactical plan, but they should have the proper understanding between them. 

#### chapter 11: Decisiveness and uncertainty: 

- This chapter starts by saying about the strong and the great sniper among them, chris kyle, he was the charlie platoon's point man and the lead sniper, the most experienced one and the best one in the seal, he was nicknamed as "The legend", he also followed the extreme ownership and also be in the planning and execution of every plans, he always do practice the extreme ownership, when others get bored after some time, he maintained and stayed discipline. Babin and Kyle are caught in a dilemma of positive identification (PID), or the personal identification of an enemy. Kyle had observed a figure that was moving suspiciously in a room they had identified as A27, and he was worried that the individual belonged to the team of enemy snipers who had previously killed a dozen U.S. soldiers. Babin was also disturbed by this person, of whom they completely failed to identify. As the commander-in- charge, Babin was supposed to give a directive of shooting this enemy sniper dead. Kyle, on his side, felt uncomfortable of shooting this guy, as he had a second thought that, just maybe, the individual in the building was not the enemy. The two almost succumbed to the pressure of the platoon commander who wanted the building cleared because, on his side, it was determined that there was no U.S. soldier in that building. 

- Key Takeaways: A leader will not always know the enemies plan and not even know the consequences of the action and decision they make during the fight, during the fight in the battlefield the leader must have many questions in their head like who is attacking us and how many of us are wounded and how badly wounded, etc. but in that situation leader should stop in the fear, he should take sudden action and the action should be based on the immediate information that is available for them. 

#### chapter 12: Discipline equals freedom and the dichotomy of leadership: 

- This chapter is narrated by Willink, and describes a time in Baghdad, Iraq, when it was their time to determine who they had killed or captured while gather intelligence on the same. Getting evidence was a way of ensuring that cases are developed against those captured or detained. He goes ahead to analyze their past method of collecting evidence, which he refers to as being problematic and non-efficient in that once evidence had been collected, it could not tell who collected it, when it was collected, as well as difficulty ascertaining whether a given room had been cleared or not. 

- Interestingly, the courts in Iraq had evidence indicating the exact room from which the information was retrieved. Willink then reaches out to his Assistant Officer in Charge (AOIC) and requests him to devise the best way in which it could be done to comply with the requirements of the courts. At first, the team denied the new evidence brought but Willink took the role of explaining and asks them if they can give it a trial run. At first, the entire team denies the new changes to be introduced, and Willink took the role of explaining the essence to the team and asks them if they can give it a trial. After two successful trials, he led the team in the implementation of the new system while on a mission in Baghdad, a mission where everything was completed within twenty minutes clearing, securing, and searching the target building. This had laid a baseline of solid and disciplined search procedures. Their freedom, therefore, to operate and maneuver had increased substantially through disciplined procedures, thus discipline equals freedom. 

- Key Takeaways: the leader must balance between the discipline and freedom and find the equilibrium in the dichotomy of many seemingly contradictory qualities, between one and another extreme. By the appreciation and recognition, he got, the leader can balance the two opposite forces easily and lead the force with the maximum effectiveness.
