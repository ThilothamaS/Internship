### DAY 19 SUMMARY:

- Class started by recalling about array, object, function, conditions and loops and how to access the values present in the arrays and objects. Arrays can be accessed by using the index value and changed by calling the calling the index value and the value which that index holds into other value. The structure of the object is basically made of keys and value and the objects can be accessed through the keys which holds the value and also can be change the values in the object using the key. The object and array is of similar structure like in the array we can use index value to access the value and in object we can access the value using the key and the key in object and index value in array plays the similar role. 
- Conditions, there are four major types of conditional statements we commonly use and they are if, if-else, else if and switch. If condition is the which only gives output only when the given condition is true and about if-else condition it consist of only one condition, but it still gives output if the first if statement is false and the output will be the else statement and about the else if condition, it consist of many condition, if first condition becomes false, then that goes to the second condition(else if statement) and that goes on until one of the condition becomes true and if none of the condition becomes true, it will finally goes to the else statement. Switch statement is the one which is used instead of the else if conditional statement and where there is many conditions are used in one problem, there the switch statement is used, the structure of the switch statement will be like switch element or a variable and the cases(these are like the conditions that is used in the else statement), there can be many cases used for one problem and a break statement to break the condition if that statement becomes true.  
- Loop statement, the steps of the program must not be repeated, so for not repeating the lines of the program the loops can be used.
- Function, Today i have learned about how to read the function step by step and how to give output for the function properly. If there is no function call, the function does not work it will be like a dummy function. We have to start reading the function after the function call only and when there is many function used in the program, we have to start from the function which is called first among those function and a function can also be called inside another function. 
- I have learned about how to give a output for the function properly and in today's class i have come through many different problems based on function and we have tired to give output for those programa as well. By trying those programs and trying to give output for those programs, i slightly understood how to read and give output for the program that consist of function in it.
- Also today, a test takes place in the class about the function topic, there will be some programs given for us as the question and we have read that program and after understanding the program we have give the output for the program and from my side, i really understand some of the programs in that and in some programs, there is conditions were used and given true and false in that condition and its really confusing for me. To answer all the question, i have answered all the question based on my understanding and i don't know if its correct or not.

#### Connecting to database :
- In drizzle ORM, i have tired to connecting to database to create the tables in the database, but as i am working with drizzle ORM for the first time. It becomes a light tough for me connect to the database and for the last two days i am trying to connect to the database itself.
- In my first project, i didn't used any ORM in that crud project, i only used a plain database and connect to it. 
- Using drizzle ORM and connecting to the database, it was a little difficult for me to understand and to connect to the database.

#### Struggles faced :
- Today, the struggle i majorly faced is the process of connecting to the database using the drizzle ORM. I don't know how to connect to the database using the ORM and i didn't understand that also, and without a clear understanding even after reading the documentation for drizzle, i can't able to connect to the database using the ORM. I think, it will become easy after learning it properly and with the clear understanding.

#### key Takeaways : 
- Today, i have learned about how to read the function step by step and how to give output for the function.
- I have learned about drizzle ORM and database connection.
- A important thing i have learned today, if you want to shine in a field or want to learn something new, you have to take the responsibility and you have start learning. No one will be there to push you to take your own responsibility.
