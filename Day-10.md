### DAY 10- INTERNSHIP REPORT:
#### PROBLEM SOLVING:
- Throughout the entire day, i have solved some problem based on arrays. Problems like joining two arrays and arranging the numbers in the array in the ascending order, this is the first problem i took today, i have tried many ways to solve this problem like using single loop and comparing numbers in the first and next index value and rearranging them in the separated loop which i have declared previously, it does work for the two array of same length but i couldn't be able to solve that while adding another number to the second array, so i tried using two loops, like first comparing the whole first array values with the second array and it worked in a different way but doesn't give an perfect output and finally, i tried to push all the values in to a single array and tried sorting that array into a ascending order and i used two loops here to sort the values inside the array. By using this sorting into ascending order method i have finally cleared the first problem i took.
- FOR LOOP IN ARRAY: For loops are used to iterate over the array of number to perform operations in the particular indexes values and iterates over each and every element in the array.
- The next problem I am working on is also based on an array of numbers. It involves finding how many times each number appears in the array. Same as before i used for loop to iterate over the entire length of the array and to compare the particular value's repetition and separately take the specific number in another array and compared that number with the whole length of the another array and by taking an empty variable and adding 1 for every repetition will help to find out the repetitions of a particular number in an array.
- The next problem is similar and can also said as continuation of the previous problem. In the previous problem, i have to find only one number's repetition value and in this problem i need to find the repetition of the numbers present in the array consist of three values and must separately give the repetition value of each number present in the array. For this, i have tried using two loops and the first loop have to iterate over the small array and inner second loop must iterate over the array in which i am calculating the repetitions. By this method i can find the total number of times each numbers repeated in the array and it gives the value as all together. But, the problem is to find out the repetition of each values separately and to do this, i used another array, like declaring an array which only consist of 0s in each indexes and through the iteration i have increased the values from 0 to 1. By this increment method, i have find out the repetition of each values in the array.
- The last problem i solved today is also based on the array of numbers and here i need to pick out the even numbers present in the array and square the even numbers and by using the for loop and if conditions i have solved this problem.

#### Key Takeaways:
- learned to solve problems using array.
- learned how to merge two arrays in a single array.
- learned to find the repetition of numbers over an array.
