### DAY 32 SUMMARY:
- Errors and Exceptions : Errors means the mistakes that made by the developer in the code, which can fixed by the developer, but exceptions are the which is also like a error and that cannot be fixed by the developer. There are many types of errors and exception and there are two times where the errors takes place, they are compiler time and run time error. 
- Compiler time is when the program is in the compilation mode and this checks the tokens, syntax and semantics, if there is any mistakes in the syntax and semantics in the code, it will throw an error and run time error is the one which takes place while the code running and the error will stop the code in the middle of the run and will not give any output.
- Exceptions means the error that does takes place and that cannot be fixed, it can handled and the exceptions in the code can be handle with the method called error handling. Error handling is which helps with handling the error in the code which can't be fixed and this error handling helps in the continuing of the run of the code even after the error found and the error handling method consist of two keywords, they are try and catch.
- Try and catch are the two main keywords in the error handling process, it is used when the code has the error and that cannot be fixed and there we can use try and catch method and in the try and catch, we can give the program statements inside the try function and then continued by that we can use the catch function and it works like, if any error happens in the code that is inside the try statement and then the error will be catch in the below statement and this is gives a error message as a output and this will never stops the code in the run time and with try and catch, the code will continue running after the error too. In usual code, the code will not give any output when it has a error in it, but with try and catch method, the code will give the output like an error message.
- Webpage for the ticket booking app(API): Currently i am developing a webpage for the ticket booking app(API) to call the endpoints here and to get the output as i wanted. I have simply designed the webpage with the search bar, that is used to search movie or theater with the default location and the default date at the moment from the user, for this i have tried to get the default location from the user using the geolocation method with the latitude and longitude.
- After getting the location from the user as a default, i have tried to set the search data like movie name and theater name as a optional one and for this, i have stored the found location in the local storage of the webpage and then used that data with the input data for the post request in the webpage.
- For this i have get the data from the database using fetch all theaters and movies endpoint and stored that fetched data in the indexed db like storing in the local storage to use it later. This will help to check if the given input is a movie name or a theater name.

#### Key Takeaways: 
- I have learned about local storage method in the webpages and how to store data in the local storage.
- I have learned to get data and store it in the indexed db and also learned about what is indexed db.
- I have learned about the methods of error handling.
- I have learned the method to get the access from the user to get the current location of the user.
