### DAY-11 SUMMARY:
#### API[APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE]:
- API is a set of rules or a protocol that helps the software application to communicate with each other. The software applications communicate through request and responses and it allows different software applications to exchange data, features and functionality between each other and it only gives a controlled access to the data sets that are isolated from others within different system. 
- Its uses : It is used to simplify the software development process and also used for the developers to create a application which is secure, powerful, and user-friendly.
- Web APIs are used to represent the HTML web pages and it ia accessed using hypertext transfer protocol [http]. In simple words, API is a interface which sends a call to the server backend system when any user rises any request and search that information in the database and gives the user related responses. For example, if i am searching for any javascript course in the web browser, the API is the interface there that rises a request call in the server backend and search for the courses that are stored in the web browser's database and gives the response as best courses in the stored list.
- Similar to this API, there is another one called graphical user interface[GUI], only one major difference is there and that is API gives access to the developers for different web tools and GUI makes the program easier for the user to understand.
- API is a safer one like it includes authorization credentials and API gateways and the gateways only gives limited access to every other applications and it prevents the web services from the security threats.
- API Architecture : The Architectures used in API are REST(Representation state transfer) and SOAP(simple object access protocols) and these architectures are also comes under the types of API.
- REST : This type of API uses HTTP to __GET, PUT, POST, DELETE__ data and it allows interactions between the restful web services and set the functions like GET, POST, PUT AND DELETE, it access the client to server.

#### HTTPS[HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SECURE]:
- It is used in the secured way of tranfer of data between the clients and the server and secured ways of transfer is based on encryption, authentication, data integrity. These three allows the data to be secure and unreadable in the middle way and checks the server's identity and does not allows the information to change in the middle of the tranformation. 
- GET AND POST METHODS : These two methods is used to request and get the data from the server and GET method is the one which request the data from the server without altering it and don't involve data manipulation. But the POST method sends the data from the client to the server and it also involves in the modification of the tranferring data.

#### FRAMEWORKS USED IN SERVER SIDE APPLICATIONS:
- A framework is like a pre-built structure that helps developers build applications faster and more efficiently by providing ready-made tools, libraries, and guidelines. The types of frameworks in the server side application used in javascript are nest.js, fastify, node.js.
- DATABASES USED : A database is a place where you store and manage data in an organized way. It helps applications store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently.The different databases used in javascript are MySQL, Postgres, Oracle.
- ORM : ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that allows developers to interact with a database using objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. The different ORM in javascript are prisma, typeorm, drizzle.

#### Key Takeaways: 
- I have learned about what is mean by API and how it is used in web servers and how it is used in the secure transfer of data between the user and the server.
- Learned about what is mean by frameworks and what are the different frameworks used in the server side applications in javascript.
- Learned about what is mean by databases and how it is used in storing relational data and manages the data stored. 
- Learned about what is mean by ORM and its uses.
