### DAY 13 SUMMARY:
#### DATA & DATABASE:
- Data is the one which consist of everything like all information, these data are used for analysing and processing. Database is a structure that consist of all the data within that, a database is the one that stores the data. Database helps to organize the data and that data can be easily managed.
- It can also be used in various types of applications and websites to store the data. In short, a database is an essential tool for storing, organizing, and retrieving data in an efficient and secure way.

#### Programming language:
- Programming language is the one which is used by developers to communicate with the computers, instructions that are understandable by the computer and can execute it. Those programming languages has a set of rules and meaning and it is a combination of symbols. And there are semantics that is the meaning of those syntax. There are two types of programming language, high level language and low level language.
- Symbols: There are different types if symbols used in programming language like mathematical operator (=, !=, +, -, >, <, /, %, etc.) and alphabets are also the symbols in programming language (a-z and A-Z) and numbers are also a symbol in programming language and those double quotes, single quotes and brackets are some of the symbols used.
- Tokens: There are many token used in the programming language and token in the combination of all symbols. Some of the example tokens are hello, 100, adding, multiple, etc. A token is the one that gives a meaning and it consist of symbols.
- Expressions: These are the combination of two or more symbols and in programming language, a expression is like a operation that is given as a input to give a output. For example, x = 10 and y = 15 is one of the expression in the programming language and it can written with a addition operator to give the addition of the two numbers.
- Keywords: A keywords are the one which are a constant one and that consist of a single meaning and the meaning of those keywords cannot be changed. For example, let, var, const, for, if etc. These are some of the keywords that are used for variable declaration, conditions and in loops.
- Variables: These are the containers that stores the values which is used later for further uses in the programs and these are the one which can be declared using those keywords let, var, and const. For example, let num = 10; This is the correct format for the declaration of the variable.
- Datatypes: Datatypes refers to the type of data that a variable can store within it, in programming language, there are different types of data the can be stored and can be used later and each datatype has a particular range that can be stored.
- There are two types of datatypes, they are primitive datatype and the complex datatype. Primitive data are string, integers and numbers, and boolean and complex data are array, maps, objects etc.
- Declaration of a sentence: There is a particular structure for the declaration of variable, like keywords/datatypes + variable name + assigning operator + data + sentence terminator.

#### CREATION OF DATA TRANSFER OBJECT:
- I have tried to create data transfer object in the crud application creation in the nestjs framework. And downloaded insomnia to run the application. 
- I have tried to connect the database to the dto that i have written but it doesn't work.
- I have tried of many ways to write the queries to connect to the database but it doesn't work.

#### Key Takeaways:
- Learned about programming language. 
- Learned to write data transfer object.
- Learned about different types of datatypes.
