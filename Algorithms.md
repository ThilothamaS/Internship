### ALGORITHM FOR PROBLEM:
#### 1.Multiplying a four digit number without using the multiplication function and using addition:
1. declare two variables and assign the values for the variables as four digit number(a = 1234 & b = 1000).
2. Instead of using multiplication for multiplying these numbers, add the first number in the range of the second number.
3. Declare a variable (sum = 0) and use for loop to add 'a' in the range of 'b'.
4. And add the a value in the sum variable.
5. print the output.

#### 2. Finding the GCD of two non-prime numbers:
1. Declare two variables and assign values (a = 4 and b = 6).
2. using for loop, starts with 'i' as a number 1 and i is less than or equal to 'a' and 'b'.
3. give a if condition (a%i && b%i == 0) and then give the value to the variable gcd = i.
4. print the output.

#### 3. Decoding the morse code :
1. Declare the a object and assign all the values and symbols in that object (all alphabets and their symbols).
2. iterate through the entire object using the for loop and symbols of their letters.
3. give the if condition, if the input symbol is equal to the symbol in the object, select the letter and join it as a word.

#### 4. To sort 5000 certificates in the reverse alphabetical order:
1. Declare a variable that consist of the certificates in a random order.
2. first sort the order of the certificates in a alphabetical order using the 'sort()' function.
3. then reverse the sorted certificates to give it in a reverse alphabetical order.
4. give the output as a reversed alphatical ordered certificates.

#### 5.Printing the internship string 5 times :
1. Declare a variable and assign the string internship in it.
2. Declare another variable and assing 2025 to it and concat the first two strings using addition.
3. use for loop to print the string 5 times like (i=0;i<5;i++) this is the condition of the loop.
4. print the output.

#### 6. Minimizing the 12 digit numbers into single digit number:
1. Declare the variable and assign the 12 digit value into it and declare an empty array and remove the last digit using modulus method.
2. separate the number and store it in the empty array.
3. multiply the number with 2 and store the value in the array and declare another variable and assign the sum value into the variable.
4. the sum value of the multiplied number of each can be identified by using the for loop and if conditions(if the number is greater then 10 then add the two digit number by separating them using modulus and division).
5. Again using the if condition (if the is equal to the last number of the 12 digit after removing the last digit it is valid else it is invalid).
6. print the output.

#### 7. Finding the max in the array:
1. Declare the array of various number.
2. declare a variable max and use it for storing the maximum value.
3. use for loop to find the max value and store it.
4. compare each of the array value with the max value and assign the max value into the variable.
5. print the output.
