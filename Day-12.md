### DAY 12 SUMMARY:
#### WEB DEVELOPMENT:
- HTML : Hypertext markup language(HTML) is a standard language that is used to create all the text and wordings in the webpages, it is used to create and structure the webpage. It consist of many structure elements, tags and elements, links and navigations etc.
- It is also used to upload image, video and audios in the webpages. There are 6 types of header tags in the html tags and they are used to give different types of headings in the webpages.
- CSS : Cascading styling sheets(CSS) is the one which is used to style the webpages and it is mostly like a styling language that is used to style the buttons and text that is created by using the webpages. It is also used to present the HTML elements on a webpages.
- It gives how elements should be displayed in terms of colour, size, font, spacing, positioning, and more. There are three types of CSS and they are inline CSS, internal CSS and external CSS. It selects the HTML elements by using .class, #id, etc.
- HTML builds the structure of a webpage, but CSS makes it look good. Without CSS, web pages would just be plain text and images. For example, Imagine a house (HTML) with plain walls. CSS is like painting the walls, adding decorations, and arranging furniture to make it look beautiful.
- FLEX IN CSS : Flex in CSS is a layout system which arrange all the rectangular boxes in a rows or columns. It adjust the elements to fit in the space and arrange it evenly spaced. 
- GRID IN CSS : Similar to flex grid is also like a layout which arrange all the elements created in the webpage in a order to a row or columns. It makes complex layouts easy. There is only one different in between the two of these and that is grid has a precise control over the styling of the elements in the proper placement. 
- JAVASCRIPT : Javascript is the one which adds the interactivity to the webpage. For example , with the use of HTML we can create the text and buttons in the webpages and using CSS we can design the buttons created using the html and with the use of javascript we can make the button interactive like giving the onclick attribute, the button created must be interactive to click on it and go to the next page.

#### INSTALLATION OF DATABASE :
- I have installed postgresql database to connect with the nestjs in the visual studio code. For this installation process, i have read some documents and some commands which can used to download the postgresql.
- I have read many documentation to learn how to connect both nest js with database that i have been using and i have learned some codes for making this connections of the postgresql in vscode.
- I have also tried to connect the postgresql with the nestjs using the codes in the online documentations and i have also completed it successfully.
- The next step is  i have tried to create the datatable using datamodule in the nestjs and i have tried some codes which i have learned from the documents, but it showed some error and i have tried many ways to create a datatable and sometimes i didn't even understand the wordings in some docx and i have completed it successfully but i dont know how to connect the datatable with database that i have installed.
- And after connecting with the database, i have tried to run that code in the terminal, but it showed some error.
