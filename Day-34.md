### DAY 34 SUMMARY:
- Today, i have tried to clear the error which arises while adding data into the indexed database, entering data into that indexed db. showed many error and some of them are really tough for me to understand, so i do research with the error and first i tried to understand the meaning of those errors, then i have tried many ways to clear those errors, but still the data didn't get entered into the database, then i found another method of entering data into the indexed db., and that method uses small function to enter the data one by one into the data like creating the key path first and giving a name to that key path and then creating the indexes which helps to store the data into it, i have created indexes for every that i fetched from the database, this process is similar to creating the schema in the drizzle ORM to setup to the database, and here it is called as indexes and these indexes are also used to search and get data from the database again.
- By separating code into small function, i have tried to enter the data that i have fetched from the data base into the indexed db., it was like breaking down a big problem into a simple one, i tried to broke down the function to enter the data into database, i create separate function for fetching data from the database and i written a separate function for opening the indexed db. and giving it a name and for creating the separate tables for movie data enter and theater data enter and then i have written a separate function for writing schema for both movie data entry and theater data entry.
- Then i have tried to fetch and insert data into the indexed db. while the body of the html page is loading, to do this function, i have called each of the function into another function and called that function into the body onload event and then after entering the data into the indexed db., i have tried to fetch the data from the indexed db. using the index name which i have created in the database schema creation and i have tried to fetch data from the indexed db. using the search text that is been searched by the user while using the webpage.
- After fetching the data using the search text from the user, i have tried to fetch the movie or theater details using the search text from the user, that is if the user search for the movie name, then using that search text i have check if the text is a movie name or a theater name by giving the same text into both the indexed db. to check if the data similar to that text available in the database and if any data similar to the text available in the database, i will then fetch the data from the database using the Axios method of fetching the data, like if the entered search is a movie name, then it show the theater details related to the movie and if the entered search is a theater name, then it will show the movie details that has been displaying in that particular theater.
- Then the fetched data will be displayed for the user, if the user search a movie name then all the theaters that is displaying the movie will the displayed to the user and if the user search for theater name, then all the movies that has been displaying in that theater will be displayed for the user. Then the user can select the theater or movie on their own preference, not only the theater name, along with the theater name, number of seats in the theater, address of the particular theater, description of the theater, everything will be displayed for the user and they can select the theater based on their choice. 
- And i am also going to fetch the available seats present in the theater based on the search of the user. Then the user also can book movie tickets with this webpage and i am going to add these details in my future works.

#### Key Takeaways: 
- I have learned how to create indexed database in the webpage and also learned to insert data into the database by creating the schema of the database.
- I have learned about arrow functions and also learned to call the function which has the async and promise statements with it.
- I have also learned to fetch data from the indexed db. using the index name that i have created while creating the schema of the database using the get method.
- I have learned to clear the errors which has been arise while entering the data into the indexed db.
