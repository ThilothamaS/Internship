### DAY 31 SUMMARY: 
- Today, I have tried to create webpage for the ticket booking app's API, i have decided to design my webpage with some buttons that consist of the API calls and listing the output of the endpoint, for this, i have been using serve static to work with basic html, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created a search bar in the first page of my webpage and i will be used to search with the location of the user, i have also created a button using html button tag and styled that button with some CSS techniques and this button used to get all theaters from the get endpoint, to fetch from the endpoint and for giving input data, i have used axios, i have downloaded this in my application and used this in my webpage to provide the inputs to the endpoint calls.
- First i have used the get all theaters endpoint, because it is the one which consist of only one input, that is a page number, i wanted to call this endpoint by clicking on the button and moves to next page and fetching all the data in the next pages of the html webpage and for doing this functionality, i have used onclick function in the html and by using this onclick, i have linked the second page in the button of the first page and then i have decided to give two buttons in the second page which displays after clicking on the button in the first page, the buttons like previous and next for using this buttons to move pages in the endpoint that is using the pagination. 
- To move to next page and to move from one page to another page, i have used anchor tag in the html and linked that second page with the button of the first page and used onclick attribute to move to the next page. Then, i have decided to fetch all the theaters from the database using the endpoint by using the URL of the endpoint like i have given the URL in the insomnia to get the output and here also i have to get the responses for the endpoint call.
- After fetching all the data from the database, i have tried to display the output data in the webpage's second page where the previous and next buttons are there and to display this in the webpage, i have used list tag to list all the data which has came as the output and i have also used list and listed the data in the webpage, but that still not looking so good to view as a webpage and to change this, i have used table tag in the html and tried to display the output response in the table, to display the output, i have created a table first and then added all the contents within that table using JavaScript and by using css i have tried to style that table.
- It is quiet better to display the response using the table instead of displaying them in the list, because in the list, it is not looking like a display of the response, it is just looking like a text content, but using the table to display the response, it is better to display them in the table.
- Now, i am trying to make use of the two buttons that i have created using html and CSS and i have been trying to use the buttons to move from one page to the another.
