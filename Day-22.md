### DAY 22 SUMMARY:
- Today, i made some changes in my endpoints, because i made some mistakes in that, so i had changed that. i have made changes in the function like completely deleting the whole endpoint and again changed it into a normal function to call it into the another endpoint, so that it can run into that another endpoint function and i have tried to set timing for that function to happen and i set the timing into 30 seconds.
- The function had to run after that 30 seconds, i have tried to set the timing for 30 seconds by using the set timeout function and i have tried to call the function which has to run after the lag of 30 seconds.
- Set timeout function is the one that is used to delay the particular function and the syntax of that function is like just simply call the function that needs to be run in delay inside the set time out function and set the timing in milliseconds and that milliseconds can be converted into seconds (set Timeout(function Name , time in milliseconds)).
- The time out function can be set in the endpoint of book tickets and then calling the another normal function into the endpoint function. I have used (this. function name) this type of function calling because i have written the function inside the App service class (when you call the function which is the inside the class, it should be called with the use of the this. function call).
- I have tried to call the function inside the set time out function and it doesn't work because the function which has called inside the class cannot work inside the set time out function, so i have tried to declare a variable and assign the function inside the variable and not assigning the parenthesis of the function inside the variable and again assigning the variable inside the set time out function and calling the function parameter with that variable name.
- And again i tried to run the function after changing all the mistakes and it does work and set timeout only works function the function of deleting the data from the table and again adding the data inside the bookings table and again i tried to run that function using different data but still doesn't work. And then i tried to set the possibilities of ticket booking into 80% booking pass and 20% bookings fail.
- For doing this i have no idea at first like how to set the percentage possibility of bookings then i searched this in the google, then still i didn't find any clue of how to calculate the percentage of the success bookings, then i again searched it in the google and this time i have found some clues like using the probabilities in the success percent and failure percent.
- Then i have decided to apply probability method for finding the success percent and failure percent in the booking of each ticket, i have to use this probability before the function which consist of the delete and insert function for both processing and bookings table respectively, if i add this before the delete and insert function, if the booking is a success then the data will be deleted from the processing table and enter into the booking table, but if the ticket booking fails it will remains in the processing table and not enter into the booking table.

#### Struggles faced :
- I have faced struggles while searching for the set timeout function like i have the syntax of the set time out function but i don't know how to use it in the asynchronous function and then i again searched the syntax for the set timeout with the async function, then i found an arrow function syntax for the time delay but that doesn't work and then i again searched for the proper syntax without the arrow function and then i found the right syntax and used it. 
- After that i faced struggles in deleting and inserting data into the tables and that function still doesn't work and i need to fix the problem in my logic.

#### Key Takeaways : 
- I have learned how to delay the function using the set timeout function and calling the function inside the function to delay that.
- I am trying to find the logic for the probability of finding the failure of 20% in the ticket bookings.
