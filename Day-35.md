### DAY 35 SUMMARY:
- Today, i have made some changes in the webpage that i have created, in first i have just created a basic version in the webpage where i have used some html forms to give and get input from the user, this leads to entering a same data multiple times in the same webpage multiple times and that will become a irritation for the user, so i have made some changes in the webpage to create a user-friendly webpage. 
- To create a user-friendly webpage, i have given a onclick function to the div-tag which consist of the theater details, this theater details will be get as a output after a user search a movie name in the search bar and then after searching for the movie name, the user can easily click onto the theater details and on clicking on the theater details will fetch the available seats from the theater and to fetch this available seats, i have stored the movie name, theater name, date and shows from the function which is used to create the div tag to display the movie name and the corresponding theater details which is related to the movie name.
- If there is multiple theater that consist of same movie in it, then the multiple theater details will be displayed as a output and it will be displayed in separate div-tag in the html and if the user clicks on one of the theater details, it will then ask a input from the user to give a show name and then it will fetch the available seats based on the theater( in which the user clicks on ), show name( input from the user after the user clicked on the theater details ), movie name( the search input given by the user at first ), and date.
- After fetching the available seats related to the theater name, i have tried to make the fetched available seats which is displayed on the webpage to be clickable by the user and this clickable seat number will help the user to select the seat number on their own choice for making these available seats clickable, i have created a onclick function on the span tag that contains the available seats in them and also made some difference in the styling of the fetched available seats and if the seats are already booked then it has to blocked and there is no clickable function for those seats which have been already booked and then if the seat is not booked yet, then it has to be shown as the button with green border and then if the seat number is selected by the user for the booking then that should change its color into full green color including the border and background of the button which displays the seat number.
- After selecting the seat number by the user, it has book the seats for the user for the particular movie, in that particular theater, in the date, and for that particular show name and this booking only starts after the user clicks on the book now button which only be displayed after the user selected the seat numbers properly and when the user clicks on the book now button it will redirected to another page and in that page the booking function will takes place and that booking function will call a endpoint which is used for booking the tickets for the movie and this endpoint needs five inputs namely, movie id, theater id, date, shows, and finally the seat numbers, for fetching the movie id and theater id by using the input movie name and theater name, i have tried to fetch the movie id from the indexed db. by giving the movie name in the index and search for the index name, by this process i have got the movie id from the indexed db. and for the theater id fetching i did the same thing like searching with the theater name which i already have and using this i get both movie id and theater id and with movie and theater id, i have written a function that is used make the post call for the endpoint and using this the user can book the movie tickets.
