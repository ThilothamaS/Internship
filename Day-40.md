- Realizing our own potential, people should first be able realize their own potential and need to know what are they good at and where to use this skills, that realization will only comes when enter the context and practice doing something, if one still feels like they have the low potential in the context even after practicing for a long time, then that is not their context, they need to realize that and have to change their context where they'll shine and their talents and skills can be used.
- There must be a graph in our life for the potential we have, at first like in our young age, we will have high potential and the potential will not always be high throughout our life, it needs to be decrease with the flow of our life, then realizing the potential, there will be another line which says about realizing the potential, at our young we will not be able to realize our potential, after practicing and after getting used by the context only we can be able to realize our potential, this graph for realizing the potential have to be increase with the flow of our life and also there is no use if someone do not realize their potential and their context, at last their potential will not be used by any of the context. 
- In our life, we are the one whose is going to select the context, in which our skills are going to be used and for this we have select the proper context to shine, we have select the context where our skills and talents can be used and where we will shine and will have high potential, potential is not just the thing that you can easily realized and used, the realizing of our own potential will take time, the key way to realize our potential in the context is practicing, practice will make you realize what is your potential in that particular context.
- There are mainly four sides and four sectors that we need to consider while selecting a context, the four sides are unchangeable, changeable, extrinsic and intrinsic, unchangeable thing are the one which we can't be change and changeable things are the one which can be changed, extrinsic things are the one which is exterior and intrinsic things are the one which is interior, there are part like extrinsic unchangeable and that is like weather condition in the particular area and we cannot change the weather based on our choice, intrinsic unchangeable, it will be like our inner talents ad skills which can't be changed, extrinsic changeable is the one which will be like the context and we can be able to change them as we need, intrinsic changeable are like our interest, passion etc. we can change them to set in the environment.
- We need to select the context based on these four things and if all of them align properly for you, then that is the properly context for you to shine, if one of any will not align then you will lose something and you have if that is important or is that context worth losing things, and also need to decide based on our goals.
