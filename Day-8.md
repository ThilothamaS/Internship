### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
- Programming language is one of the medium for communication between the human and the machine. It helps human to communicate with the computer, machines only understands 0s and 1s, and these programs are just for human understanding and to make it meaningful. 
- There are three types of programming languages, machine level language and high level language. Machine level languages are for machines like just 0s and 1s and high level languages are for human understanding. High level languages are written by human and then it is converted into machine level language for computer to execute the instructions properly.
- Assembly level languages are low level language and it will more easy for human to read and it does not use binary instructions.

#### Rules for writing English sentences:
 - Start with a capital letter, full stop at the end of the sentences, make the sentence meaningful, use commas when continuing the sentence, use capital letter after ending a sentence with the full stop.
 - There are two main conditions for writing, the rules and the meaning behind the rules. The rules are also called as syntax and the meaning is also known semantics in computer language.

#### Compiler:
 - compilers are the one which translate the high level language into machine level language for machine to understand and follow the given instructions.
 - A language is the one which has symbols(alphabets, numbers, special characters),token(the collection of all the symbols),expression(the collection of tokens and the expression should be valid).
 - symbols are like alphabets and different special character which has a different meaning and tokens, it is like a combination of one or more symbols, when you add different symbols together it will given a word and that is a token. The expression, it is a combination of many token together and it is like a sentence, it has to give a proper meaning. 

#### Task:
- Today's task is to create a language that functions like decoding another language. 
- For doing this task, we have to separate into a team of three. The language we created has to be valid and it has to satisfy all the rules for a language. It must not be in a easily decodable ways and it has to be hard for others to decode. 
- The language must contain all the symbols required for decoding complex patterns. It should provide meaning, and others must use the same process to decode the entire language.

#### Solving problems:
- Today, I solved problems based on strings. Reversing the string and equating the letters present in two strings. 
- In the first problem, I first find out the length of the string using for loop like giving the condition __i!==undefined__ and it works like iterating throughout the whole and stopped when the index value become undefined. Then with the length of the string, I tried reversing the string using __i--__ iteration (iterating from the last index to the first) and taking the index value reversed.
- In the second problem, the first string consist of five letters word and the second string consist of three letter and i need prove those three letters in the second strings are matched with the first string's last three letters. I tried to solve the problems using two for loop and and doesn't work because i made some mistakes in that. Then, using __continue__ and __break__ keywords i solved that problem.

#### Key takeaways:
- I have learned how use iteration in the string.
- I have learned about how count the length of the string or an array using for loop.
- I have learned about how and where to use keywords like continue and break.
- i learned about what is programming languages and what is the use of programming language.

#### Struggles faced:
- I struggled with solving the second program because i don't know how to use and where to use those continue and break keywords.
- i need to practice solving more problems to learn how to use some keywords.
