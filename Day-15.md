### DAY 15 SUMMARY:
#### FUNCTION:
- Function is a block of instructions given for the computer and and the function block in the program doesn't work until it is called again. The syntax of function is, it has a function name, have a parameter for giving the input, a body of the function that given within the curly brackets and finally a return statement which returns the function.
- The main purpose of using function in the code is to reuse the code anywhere only with calling the function name and instead of writing the whole code again and again, we can write it in a function block and call it multiple times anywhere.

#### CLASSES:
- Class is the blueprint of creating an object and it consist of a set of properties and using this, a program can be written in a more organised and clear way possible. For example, if i take the properties of dogs like name, age, cost, breed, colour etc. These are the properties in the class and it consist of a value and using that value we can create a object.
- The values for those properties can be assigned by declaring a new variable and within that the value for each properties can be given. For example, for the three properties about the dog, we can assign the values like dog1 = dog { "tommy", 1, "10 thousand" }. Like this we can assign the values and also the assigned values can be retrieved using the method of calling the property name to retrieve the value inside that property. for example, dog1.cost, this will give the cost of the dog as a output.
- CONSTRUCTOR: A constructor is the one which is used to construct the class and the object in the program and that is used to give the proper value to each of the properties in the class. This constructor checks the datatypes of the given value that is assigned to the properties and assign proper values to their properties.
- For the properties of the dog we can use the object within the class but for the actions of the dog we have to give it in a function to describe the actions of the dog, because the actions of the dog will come under a single properties, so that should be given in a function within the classes and to call this function, we can normally call the function with the help of the name of the function and also with the class name. For example, dog1.barks(), this is how the function inside the classes can be called.
- The class is of mainly two types and they are, has something(name, age, cost) and does something(barks, eats, sleeps), has something means it has a value like for the properties of the class we can assign the values and for does something, it is like the actions of the dog and it can given within the function.

#### CRUD APPLICATION:
- crud application means it has create, read, update and delete. In this POST request is used to create the new data within the database and the created request must take the input that is given by the user who is using the crud application.
- I have tried to create a login page that consist of a userid, username and password using the post request and i have successfully created one and added it to the database that i have connected already. I have installed insomnia to see the output of what i have created. 

#### Key Takeaways:
- I have learned to write the post request in the creation process.
- I have learned to create the user login page.
