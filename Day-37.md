### DAY 37 SUMMARY:
- Today, we had a session about backend development and the first topic in that was about OSI layers and there are 7 layers in the OSI model which a developer should know and the seven layers are physical layer, datalink layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer and application layer, and the physical layer is the one which is used to transmit raw bit stream over a physical medium, datalink layer is the one that is used to defines the format of the data on the network, a network layer is the one that is used to decides which physical path the data will take, transport layer is the one that is used to transmit data with some transmission protocols, session layer is the one which is used to maintain the connection and also responsible for controlling port, presentation layer is the one where the data encryption occurs and also it looks for proper format of the data which transferring, and finally application layer is the one in which the human and computer interaction takes place and application can access the network services. A developer should come from the physical layer to the application to properly develop a application and a user can straight away comes from the application layer.
- Developing a API: Then we have tried to develop a API using the bun framework. The Bun framework typically refers to the Bun runtime, a modern JavaScript runtime like Node.js, but built for speed and modern development. It can be thought of as a new all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. Comparing to other frameworks and runtime, bun will be faster among them and it has many specializations like it supports JavaScript and typescript for the runtime, bun install can used instead of the npm and yarn, a bundler, a transpiler and a test runner. It has many beautiful features in them like it is mainly used for its fast performance comparing to other runtime and it supports native typescripts.
- Elysia: Elysia is a web framework built on top of Bun, designed to be fast, modern, and type-safe, think of it as the Express.js for Bun, but much more performant and developer-friendly. Elysia is a modern framework that can be used with bun and it is used for the fast and modern development and using Elysia the developer can built a modern API, this will also support typescript like bun and that can make developer's work easy with its features. 
- We have installed these both framework and runtime in our system and after installing this, we just imported the Elysia in our index.ts file and started writing the endpoints with get request, and give that some random text to check if its working or not and then we have directed the endpoint to the port to view that locally and with some API running app like insomnia and postman. Then we have tried to run our get request in the local google chrome with the URL with the port and localhost.
- we have tried writing some request like get, put, post and delete and also we have imported the read, write files from the fs and then using this we have created a text file using the post request and then tried to update and delete that same file. Then we have installed swagger and then tried to connect our code with the swagger to visualize our endpoints and that is also used for the team communication among the team members. 

#### Key Takeaways: 
- I have learned about a new framework and runtime like bun and Elysia, i have already worked with nestjs, but this is new one for me, i thought in Elysia and bun, the structure of the endpoint varies comparing to nestjs.
- Also learned about API development with Elysia and bun and we have also tried to develop the API and it was like hands-on training for us in API development.
- Also learned about swagger, it is a new term for me, and i have learned how to install and connect to the swagger to visualize our endpoints.
