### DAY 24 SUMMARY:
- Today, I have again made some changes in my ticket booking project and the changes are like, if the seat number is already booked, the response or the output must be already booked and  if the seat number is booked for the first time means, the response must be booked with the ticket id and the theater id for which the movie ticket is booked and if the booking falls in the 20 percent of failure, the response must be a failed with the ticket id and the theater id.
- Then, for making these changes I have added a column in the bookings table like status for adding the status of the booking like if the movie ticket is booked or failed and i have used if conditions and if the ticket is booked for the first with seat number and the showname, the status must be either booked or failed. 80 percent the status must be booked and the remaining 20 percent it should be failed and if the ticket is booked successfully, the status column should be inserted with the value of booked and if the ticket booking fails, the status column in the bookings table must be filled with the failed value.
- Then, after checking this status this status column, I have to give the response as booked or failed and this also I have used if condition, I have selected all the values from the bookings table and after accessing all the values from the table, I have used if condition like if the status of the bookings table is filled with booked word and then the response should be booked and if the status column of the booking table is filled with failed word, then the response should be failed. The response should be given after checking the value of the status.
- Then, I have made changes in the pg table schema in the bookings table, I have added two columns in the bookings table, they are date of the ticket to be booked and the date of when the ticket has been booked. Using this, the date can be scheduled for the movie tickets and also can be book ticket for the future. 
- The user can book movie ticket for the future too with the use of giving date as the input.
- Then, I have found the available seats in the theater based on the seats booked in the theater, by using the get available seats endpoint user can see the available seats present in the theater for the movie and for the show and the date.
- I have added status column and date columns not only in the bookings table, I have added those columns in the transaction table too and if the booking failed, the  inputs should not remain redirected, It should be redirected to the booking table with the booking status failed.
- This ticket booking API is created for the user to view and search for the movie and using that they can also search the theater and then can also view the available seats in the theater and can book the movie ticket with the seat number that they wanted.

#### Key Takeaways:
- I have to prepare a proper pg table schema here after. Because all the other changes and the bookings and the processing, everything depends on what is present in my pg table, if I think and prepare that in a proper model, then the flow of the API and writing the endpoints and conditions will be easy.
- I have learned how to return the response in the insomnia after a particular time delay using the set timeout function.
