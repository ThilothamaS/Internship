### DAY 26 SUMMARY:
- In today's class, we did solved some programs and get the output for the programs. In that, particularly we solved some program that is based on the scope of the variable and how the variable can be passed into the function to run the function and how the value of the variable be unmodified still after used inside the function. For example, a variable is declared inside the main function and the variable has been assigned with the value, then the variable is passed into the function using the pass by reference format and after the function run, when the variable is printed outside the function means, the value of the variable still the same and it does not changed, because the value of the variable is not reassigned anywhere inside the function, the value of the variable only accessed and passed into the function. There is a another possibilities too, if the value of the variable reassigned inside the function, then the value in the print statement will also change based on the reassigned value.
- The value of the variable does not change and remains unchanged unless the value of the variable is reassigned. A variable has different scopes inside and outside a function, and the value of a variable passed into a function cannot be changed.

#### Ticket booking app(API):
- Today, i have found some mistakes in the API i have designed while running it like fetching available seats for the movie that is unavailable, fetching the data for the input with the past date and also been fetched data even with the wrong show name, to solve these problems i have made some validations for the inputs that i am getting like date, show name and also checked if the movie for the availability of the movie in the theater before fetching the available.
- For validating the date, if it is past date or a future date, i have used date.now() function which can be used to get the timestamp of the date in the numerical value ( the timestamp is the one which gives the time of the date in the milliseconds and this has been calculated from 1, January 1970 and the milliseconds can be calculate even for the 1 minute in the day and the future date's timestamp value will be greater number while comparing to the timestamp of the date in the past or also current date )and also i have used new Date() function for finding the current date at that time and also used the get time() function to get the timestamp of the future time by giving the future date to that function and then comparing the timestamp of the current date to the timestamp of the future date and if the timestamp value of the input date is greater than the timestamp value of the current date, then the date in the input is a valid date and if not, it is not valid and cannot fetch the available seats of the theater.
- I have also did a validation for the show name that has been given as the input, for validating the show name, i have compared this show name with the array of shows that has been present in the theater details and by comparing this show name with the array, we can validate the show, if its available in the array of shows, then it is a valid show name and we can fetch the available seats for the show in the theater and if it is not available in the array, then it is not a valid show. 
- These two validations are important also in the ticket booking endpoint also because there too input consist of the show name in the string and the date that is given to when the ticket has to be booked and that has to be a future date.
- I have also written another endpoint which is used to get the theater details by giving the input as the movie name and the list of the theater will be the output in which the particular movie has been displayed. So, with the input as the movie name, i am trying to get the theater details in which the movie is displaying and also the movie can be displayed in multiple theaters and the theaters will be the output for this endpoint.

#### Key Takeaways:
- I have learned to check if the date in the input is a past date or a future date with the help of some function which can give the timestamp of the date in the numerical value.
- I have learned about the epoch value that has been given to the date and time and it is also a timestamp of the date and that will be a standard value.
- I have learned to use the where query with the use inArray function which will compare the value with the whole array.
- I have learned about the Scope of variable inside and outside the function and reassigning the value of the variable inside the function can change the value of the variable.
