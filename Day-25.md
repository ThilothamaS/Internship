### DAY 25 SUMMARY:
- Function declaration and calling: The function should be declare with the void, it is the start of the function before declaring the function name like the format ( function functionName() ) in JavaScript, in dart the function can be started with the void and all declared variable should start with the datatype of the input that is going to be given inside the function.
- Execution stack : Execution stack means, a one over another process, the execution of the function will be in the flow of stack, the main function will be executed first, the first box of the stack will the main function in the execution and then the function call, after the function call happened, there will be another box added on top of the main function box and it will be executed next and after its execution, the function will disappear and after the program gets over, the main function box will also be disappeared. This is how the execution of the function will happen.
- The main function : The main function is the starting point of the program to start execution in the programming language like dart. Main function can be execution point of the program and the execution stack of the function starts in the main function.
- Variable declaration and accessing the value inside and outside of the function : variables that is declared outside the function can be in the global scope and that variables and its values can be accessed anywhere inside and outside the function and in the execution stack of the function the variable that are declared outside the function can be present in the main function and it will be present in the first box of the execution stack. The variable declared inside the function only can be accessed within the function body, because it is in the local scope, that values cannot be accessed outside the function.
- Working of the execution stack : The execution stack of the function will be works in the flow of main function and the first function that has been called and the another function that is called and goes on. This execution stack of the function will only be there until the steps in the function be completed, after the steps completed, the function stack will be disappeared.

#### Ticket booking app's API :
- I have completed until finding the available seats in the theater only based on  the theater id and today, i have made some changes in the conditions of the booking of the seat number in the theater, like if a seat number is booked already, then the process should stop there and should not enter into the processing table itself and the seat booking should also be based on the date, show name, movie name and the theater name, i must not be only depends on the seat number and i have written the condition for the seat number should book based on the show name, date, movie name in the particular theater. And if the seat number, show name, date, movie name everything is already available in the table means the ticket has been already occupied.
- Also made changes in getting the available seats present in the theater, i have already written this endpoint in the format of getting the available seats only based on the theater id and today, i have changed this into a post request and given some inputs like theater name to check if the theater is available and the movie name, to check if the movie is available in the theater and then book date, for which date the seat number is booked( future date ) and the show name, for which show the seat has been booked, if all these condition becomes true, the seat number has been already booked and if it does not present the seat number is not booked, this not booked seats can be added into the array and given as a output response.
- Fetching all the data in the reverse order using the pagination process, this process can be done by using the order by function in the query of the drizzle and we can order the available based on our choice, like both in the ascending order and the descending order. For fetching the from the newest data, we can use the descending order function in the order by value in the query of the drizzle. I have used this order by descending order function to get all the theaters available in the table from the newest to the oldest.

#### Key Takeaways: 
- Learned the drizzle query for changing the order of the get data in either descending or ascending order.
- Learned about the AND function in the drizzle ORM, that is used for accessing the value using multiple filter.
- Learned how to properly structure the if conditions and how to use it properly to get desired output.
- Learned about the execution stack of the function and how it works.
- Learned more about the scope of the variable inside and outside of the function.
